# Agent Instructions

Make the smallest complete change that solves the request. Read nearby code first, follow existing patterns, and avoid unrelated refactors. Treat the checked-in code and configuration as the source of truth.

## Project

React 19 · TanStack Start/Router · TypeScript · Vite+ · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn/ui with Base UI · TanStack Form · Zod · Cloudflare Workers.

- Routes: `src/routes/` (`src/routes/__root.tsx` is the app shell).
- UI components: `src/components/ui/`; shared helpers: `src/lib/`.
- Global styles/theme: `src/styles/shadcn.css`.
- Check `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, and `components.json` before changing tooling, runtime, or UI setup.

## Working Rules

- **Follow the existing architecture.** Use TanStack file routes, typed route APIs, loaders, and server functions. Do not introduce Next.js conventions. Never hand-edit generated route files.
- **Reuse the UI.** Check `src/components/ui/` before creating components. This project uses shadcn's **Base UI** variant, not Radix; follow the existing wrappers and `.agents/skills/shadcn/SKILL.md`.
- **Style consistently.** Use the existing theme tokens, `cn` from `#/lib/utils`, and `lucide-react`. Keep layouts responsive and controls accessible.
- **Respect SSR and Workers.** Keep browser-only APIs out of server/module scope. Use Cloudflare-supported APIs and bindings; never expose secrets. Do not deploy or change production settings unless asked.
- **Keep TypeScript strict.** Prefer inferred/library types; avoid `any`, unnecessary assertions, and suppressions. React Compiler is enabled, so do not add manual memoization without a clear reason.
- **Validate inputs.** Use TanStack Form for non-trivial forms and Zod for untrusted input. Check `package.json` before using optional packages such as TanStack Query or Table.
- **Keep dependencies and generated files untouched unless needed.** Use the declared package manager; do not create another lockfile or edit `node_modules`, build output, or generated files.

## Working Style — Ponytail (Lazy Senior Dev)

Be lazy about the solution, never about completeness. Prefer the smallest clear change that fully solves the request; skip unrequested features and unrelated refactors. Before editing, read the touched code and trace its callers, tests, fixtures, exports, and config. Consider compatibility and whether data could be lost or exposed.

Choose in this order: existing project pattern/helper, platform or standard-library feature, installed dependency, then the minimum new code. Reuse existing layers and interfaces; avoid speculative abstractions, wrappers, options, dependencies, and boilerplate. For bug fixes, find all callers and fix the shared root cause. Preserve validation and error handling when moving or merging code. Prefer clear code over clever one-liners.

Add a small test or assert-based check for non-trivial new logic; trivial changes need none. Never cut validation at trust boundaries, data-loss protections, security, accessibility, or anything explicitly requested. If a shortcut has a known limit, document it as `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`. Comment only on why something cannot be clear from the code.

At the end, state what you changed and checked, then add 1–2 brief lines saying what you skipped or did not check and any remaining risk.

## Official Documentation

Use the current official docs when an API or configuration is unclear. Check the version installed in `package.json` first; do not copy examples that target a different version.

Before finishing, review the diff, remove debug code and unused imports, run relevant checks, and summarize the change plus any remaining issues.

## Tooling (Vite+)

- `vp run dev` starts this repo's `package.json` dev script (port 3000); `vp dev` starts Vite+'s built-in dev server.
- Use `vp check`, `vp test`, and `vp build` for the standard checks and production build.
- Use `vp run <script>` for other `package.json` scripts or tasks in `vite.config.ts`; use `vpx <file.ts>` for ad-hoc TypeScript scripts.
- Check `package.json` and the [Vite+ command guide](https://viteplus.dev/guide/run) when unsure. Run relevant checks and report only what you actually ran. Deploy only when asked.
